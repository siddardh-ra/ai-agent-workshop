      "4. Add a light jacket: Although it's warm, the partly cloudy skies might bring a slight breeze, so pack a lightweight jacket or sweater to layer over your outfit.\n",
      "5. Sun protection: Don't forget to wear sunglasses, a hat, and apply sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun's rays.\n",
